# Archive

This folder contains experiments, recordings, and image assets that no longer form part of the maintained automation suite.  They are kept as references in case you want to review earlier prototypes or borrow snippets.

Highlights:

- `dartmake_single.py` - the original monolithic UI that predates the modular `Dartbot/` package.
- `plankmake_legacy.py` and various helper scripts - first attempts at the plank-making loop before the refactor into `PlankMake/plankmake_bot.py`.
- Screenshot assets under `Images/` plus assorted PNGs that belong to those legacy scripts.
- Quick one-off experiments such as `AutoClicker.py`, `anothertest.py` (mouse recorder), and `SikRPABot.py`.

Nothing in this directory is imported by the active projects, so feel free to ignore it unless you specifically need to demonstrate research spikes.
